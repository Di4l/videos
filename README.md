# MinGW_port

This fork has been created so I can modify, compile it with MinGW gcc and use it in eclipse.

The eclipse project files are included so you can impot it into your workspace. Be aware though that
the gcc version used to compile this project is not the "default" version I have on my system, and so
the MINGW_HOME environment variable has been changed in the project. You may have to restore it to your
default value.

The gcc version used to compile this code is v6.1.0 and the c++11 dialect flag has been used.
